I built a notes app using frontend HTML/SCSS/JS and backend with FirebaseDB. I used three components, app component, create note, and note. They pass props back and forth to one another for data flow. The app component holds the original state, which is a map. When a user creates a new note using the create note component, it passes a prop that holds the title of the new note to the app component which adds that to the map. In the display, we iterate through all the notes in the map in the div note section, where the note component then renders each Note with props passed to it. Then when a user chooses to edit a note, the note component passes the props that are edited back to the app component to update the map/db.

What did not work was trying to z-index sort. I have yet to figure out how to get the variable value zIndex in the note object to be displayed as a style rule although the logic is all there. I think it's some syntax I have yet to figure out, maybe I should know it by now but it's something I will have to continue to make progress on after the assignment even though I was attempting to do the zIndex sorting as extra credit. I also think the firebase db worked really well really fast to use making my life a lot easier.
